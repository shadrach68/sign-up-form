created a sign-up page.
I have 3 files in the sign-up folder.
The 3 files are html,css and javaScript.
i structured the form with html and designed it with css.
I used javaScript to add a bit of functionality to the form.
In the javaScript file / part, I used the .addEventListner to change the color of the border of the input field.
And i also added a bit of touch to the button, which is using the .addEventListner to add an on clik event, which will give the button a boxShadow of blue when clicked.
